üöÄ Tic-Tac-Toe Game: Deep Dive into React
This project is a re-imagination of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game based on the official React tutorial. My primary goal with this implementation is to deepen my understanding of fundamental React concepts while applying my own knowledge to improve the code architecture and the overall application experience.

If you're learning React or simply looking for a practical example, this repository will serve as an excellent base.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
React: The main library for building the user interface.

JavaScript (ES6+): The core programming language.

HTML & CSS: For structure and visual styling.

Node.js / Bun: Runtime environments for managing dependencies and running the application.

üì¶ Getting Started
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/Jommp/react-tutorial-tic-tac-toe-game.git
(Make sure to replace your-username/react-documentation-project.git with your actual repository URL).

Navigate to the project directory:

Bash

cd react-documentation-project
Install dependencies:
You can use npm or bun (if you have it installed):

With npm:

Bash

npm install
With bun:

Bash

bun install
Run the project:
Once dependencies are installed, start the application:

With npm:

Bash

npm start
With bun:

Bash

bun run start
The game will automatically open in your default browser (usually at http://localhost:3000).

‚ú® Enhancements and Future Ideas
Advanced State Management: Potentially implement useReducer or Context API for more robust global state handling.

Unit Testing: Add tests for key components and game logic.

Modern Styling: Explore styling libraries like Styled Components or Tailwind CSS.

Improved Move History: Allow "time-traveling" through moves in a more interactive way.
