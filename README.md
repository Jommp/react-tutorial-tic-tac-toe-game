# üöÄ Tic-Tac-Toe Game: Deep Dive into React

---

This project is a re-imagination of the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe game** based on the [official React tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe). My primary goal with this implementation is to **deepen my understanding of fundamental React concepts** while applying my own knowledge to **improve the code architecture** and the overall application experience.

If you're learning React or simply looking for a practical example, this repository will serve as an excellent base.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **React:** The main library for building the user interface.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** The core programming language.
* **HTML & CSS:** For structure and visual styling.
* **Node.js / Bun:** Runtime environments for managing dependencies and running the application.

## üì¶ Getting Started

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/react-documentation-project.git](https://github.com/your-username/react-documentation-project.git)
    ```
    (Make sure to replace `your-username/react-documentation-project.git` with your actual repository URL).

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd react-documentation-project
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    You can use `npm` or `bun` (if you have it installed):

    * **With npm:**
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    * **With bun:**
        ```bash
        bun install
        ```

4.  **Run the project:**
    Once dependencies are installed, start the application:

    * **With npm:**
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
    * **With bun:**
        ```bash
        bun run start
        ```

    The game will automatically open in your default browser (usually at `http://localhost:3000`).

## ‚ú® Enhancements and Future Ideas

* **Advanced State Management:** Potentially implement `useReducer` or `Context API` for more robust global state handling.
* **Unit Testing:** Add tests for key components and game logic.
* **Modern Styling:** Explore styling libraries like Styled Components or Tailwind CSS.
* **Improved Move History:** Allow "time-traveling" through moves in a more interactive way.
